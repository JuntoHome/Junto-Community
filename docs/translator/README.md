# Data Axle Translator

The Data Axle Translator is a tool in the JCA admin area that lets a library patron upload a business contacts spreadsheet, describe a target in plain terms (for example "Phoenix fabrication owners"), and download a ranked, explained shortlist as an Excel file. Typical users are business owners looking for customers and job seekers looking for employers. Phase 1 covers upload, preview, a criteria form, deterministic ranking, results and Excel export, with synthetic data only and no AI. Page: `/admin/translator`. Work is tracked in GitHub issues TR-01 to TR-35 (milestone "Data Axle Translator Phase 1").

Staging: `<URL pending>`

> **Database warning:** staging shares the production Supabase project. Logging in to the admin area, editing profiles or using the subscribe form on staging changes live data (a staging signup creates a real subscriber and emails the team). The Translator itself stores nothing, but the rest of the site on staging is live.

| [JCA_Synthetic_Contacts.xlsx](JCA_Synthetic_Contacts.xlsx) | 500 fictional records, 9 columns, sheet `Contacts`. Used for the spec walkthroughs. SHA-256: `67a510867ed6c7273cfebabea5c6895e43bd2cae2c98395acd09146ba6ed580b` |

| `JCA_Synthetic_RS_Layout.xlsx` | Added in TR-35: fictional records in the real 396-column layout |

## Two input layouts, one set of fields

| Internal field | Synthetic file | Reference Solutions export |
|---|---|---|
| `recordId` | Record ID | IUSA Number; if blank, generate `ROW-0001` style |
| `company` | Company | Company Name |
| `name` | Name | Executive First Name + Executive Last Name |
| `title` | Title | Executive Title, else Professional Title |
| `city` / `state` | City / State | City / State |
| `industry` | Industry | Primary SIC Description |
| `employees` | Employees | Location Employee Size Actual (Location Employee Size Range as fallback) |
| `email` | Email | none (real exports have no email column) |
| `phone` / `website` | none | Phone Number Combined / Website |
| `otherExecutives` | none | Executive 1 to 50 first, last, title (display only) |
| `naicsDescription` | none | Primary NAICS Description (display only) |

- One shortlist row per business.
- Required to run: company, city, state, industry.
- Ignore unknown columns and blank headers (real exports end with an unnamed column). Header names must match exactly; some contain double spaces.

## Ranking

1. Apply exclusions (a missing value is not a match).
2. Apply must-haves (a missing value fails). Count rows that failed because of missing data.
3. Score 0 to 100 from preferences. Default weights: industry 35, geography 30, title 25, employees 10. Full weight for a match in a dimension, 0 if missing. Only active dimensions count, scaled to 100. No preferences = 0. If the user orders preferences, use weights 4, 3, 2, 1.
4. Sort by unrounded score descending, then Record ID ascending. Default list size 40 (1 to 100).
5. Pinned rows first (labelled, keep their score). Omitted rows removed. Excluded rows cannot be pinned.
6. Every result lists its reasons from its own values.

## Expected results

| Scenario | Expected |
|---|---|
| Phoenix, AZ must-have; prefer Fabrication, Owner, 10 to 99; 40 rows | 500 in, 1 duplicate (SYN-0500 under SYN-0001), 499 unique, 100 eligible, 40 out, SYN-0001 first at 100 |
| Same, title Owner changed to Operations Manager | SYN-0006 first at 100 |
| Tempe, AZ; prefer Logistics, Operations Manager, 10 to 99; 30 rows | 100 eligible, 30 out, SYN-0002 first at 100 |
| City not in the workbook | Empty list with a filter-specific explanation |
| Required title Operations Manager | Rows with unknown title fail that filter |
| Altered copy of the workbook | Rejected by the file gate |

## Phase 1 rules

- **Synthetic data only.** No Data Axle connection. Never upload, copy, paste or commit real Data Axle or Reference Solutions records, not even one row.
- **Browser only.** Parsing, cleaning, ranking and export all run in the browser. Rows are never sent to the server, stored (Supabase, localStorage, cookies) or logged.
- **Independent modules.** Code lives in `src/features/translator/`: `import/`, `normalize/`, `criteria/`, `ranking/`, `export/` (no React) and `ui/`.
- **Two input layouts, one set of fields.** The 9-column synthetic workbook and the 396-column Reference Solutions export are read through mapping configs (see the table above).
- **One row per business.** Record ID is the IUSA Number, or `ROW-0001` style when blank. Industry is the Primary SIC Description. Real exports have no email; phone and website are the contact fallbacks.
- **One criteria object.** The form fills a `SearchBrief`; the Phase 2 AI will fill the same object.
- **Deterministic ranking, no AI.** The same file and the same brief always give the same order and reasons.
